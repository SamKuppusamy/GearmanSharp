v0.2.0, 2011-04-28 -- Breaking API improvements
 * Changed IGearmanJob to have an instance of JobAssigment instead of
   separate properties for JobHandle and FunctionName, to make the raw
   byte[] FunctionArgument available. This is a breaking change.
 
 * Added protected bool OnJobException(Exception, JobAssignment) to
   GearmanWorker to make it possible to handle an exception thrown by a
   job function. If it returns true, then the a wrapping
   GearmanFunctionInternalException will be thrown. If false, the Work
   method will just return false. In GearmanWorker this method returns 
   true. GearmanThreadedWorker overrides this method and returns false,
   to avoid having the work loop stopped. Regardless of what you
   return, the worker will disconnect from the server. If you don't
   want the disconnect to happen, you need to catch the exception in
   the job function.
